**The premise is simple, get to the next screen as quickly as possible. Killing enemies will give you a time bonus, allowing them to escape gives you a time penalty. Don't take too long or the x-phantom will pay you a visit!**

X-Ninja is a project I started with my 7-year-old son, Alex, to teach him the basics of programming and game design. The title and premise were his ideas, and we worked together on building levels and finding fun ways to make the game challenging; he was brimming with ideas! It's been a really fun little project to work on, and I think the game turned out much better than either of us expected.

If people enjoy the game and there's demand, we'll start working on Episode 2.

The game was developed using Construct 3 with the scripting done via Javascript. Feel free to mod, or make new levels and worlds, go wild :)
